# Docker

run docker composer
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can adjust your nginx and php settings via the Dockerfiles in the folders web and perlite

## development
there is also a development enivorment availible, this will map the perlite/ folder to the container, so you can edit the php files without rebuild of the containers
```bash
docker-compose --file docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```


## Settings

in the docker-compose.yml 
- define the starting point (root path/folder) of you notes via the environment variable NOTES_PATH
- define the exluded folders via the environment variable HIDE_FOLDERS
- define the path from your host to the container via the VOLUME

for example use this to mount you local folder `/home/user/myNotes` to your container and set the root folder 

```yml
environment:
    - NOTES_PATH=Notes
    - HIDE_FOLDERS=docs,private,trash
volumes:
     - /home/user/myNotes:/var/www/perlite/Notes:ro
```

if you dont specify any NOTES_PATH, Perlite will take `/var/www/perlite` (in the container) as starting point. This will allow you to mount more then one notes folder to the container

Example
```yml
environment:
    - HIDE_FOLDERS=docs,private,trash
volumes:
     - /home/user/myNotes:/var/www/perlite/Notes:ro
     - /home/user/documents:/var/www/perlite/Documentation:ro
     - /usr/share/lists:/var/www/perlite/Wordlists:ro
```
